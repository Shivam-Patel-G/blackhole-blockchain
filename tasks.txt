BlackHole Blockchain – 9-Day Sprint
Focus: Integrate wallet, token, staking, OTC, and DEX. Prepare for
testnet-level readiness with all systems talking to each other.
Day 1 – Integration Kickoff
(Already Defined Above)
Target: Wallet + Token integration, key management, staking module setup.
(See previous message.)
Day 2 – Token Flow + Wallet API Completion
Jay:
• Finish all wallet APIs (send, receive, view tx, create/import).
• Secure private key encryption/decryption in local memory or backend.
Shivam:
• Complete mint/burn/transfer logic in TokenX.
• Integrate token into wallet flow with simulated balances.
SaiRam:
• Build staking contract interface and stub functions (stake(), unstake()).
• Begin staking reward calculation prototype.
Nihal:
• Set up swap module: quote, calculatePriceImpact(), getSwapRate().
• Implement token-to-token swap (simple fixed liquidity pool).
Day 3 – Functional Wallet + Token & Stake Preview
Jay:
• Connect staking interface to wallet frontend.
• Implement transaction history logs in wallet.
Shivam:
• Enable token allowance + approve logic.
• Ensure internal testnet balance and metadata visible.
SaiRam:
• Link staking actions to TokenX contract calls.
• Begin validator registration and basic PoS staking logic.
Nihal:
• Create DEX pair creation logic (TokenX / TokenY).
• Link basic pool operations: addLiquidity(), getPoolStatus().
Day 4 – OTC + Multi-Signature & Escrow
Jay:
• Design and build multisig wallet structure.
• Implement API to initiate OTC tx with signatures.
Shivam:
• Add transferFrom + escrow lock to TokenX.
• Begin documenting smart contract structure.
SaiRam:
• Build escrow flow: hold token, confirm tx, release token.
• Implement basic slashing logic for validator violations.
Nihal:
• Add OTC handling to DEX interface.
• Begin adding transaction validation rules.
Day 5 – Cross-Chain Interop Research & Mock Relay
Jay:
• Begin implementing mock multi-chain wallet switch.
• Handle wallet address formats for 2 chains.
Shivam:
• Create sample TokenX wrapper for bridge simulation.
• Generate test tx JSON for bridge communication.
SaiRam:
• Build mock relay handler to relay messages (event → crossChainHandler).
• Prepare interface for bridging tokens between parachains.
Nihal:
• Design bridge DEX interface logic (selectChain, swapTokenXtoY).
• Link mock relay to DEX backend for chain-switch simulation.
Day 6 – DEX + Staking Testing
Jay:
• Create test suite for wallet interactions.
• Start writing integration documentation.
Shivam:
• Finalise token supply logic (cap, inflation).
• Simulate token farming scenario for DEX incentives.
SaiRam:
• Integrate staking with token supply (mint as reward).
• Start staking event listeners (block, tx, wallet-based).
Nihal:
• Finalise AMM-based pool logic: swap, slippage, price update.
• Create test environment for pool stress testing.
Day 7 – UI Integration Prep + Debugging
Jay:
• Prepare Swagger or Postman collection for wallet API.
• Build template API docs for frontend UI/UX dev.
Shivam:
• Final testing of all token methods.
• Begin writing deployment scripts.
SaiRam:
• Debug staking contracts.
• Simulate validator registration and stake claim cycles.
Nihal:
• Final testing of swap pairs and pools.
• Link pool contract to DEX frontend stub.
Day 8 – Full Chain Flow Test
All Devs Together:
• Conduct full chain simulation:
Create Wallet → Receive Token → Stake → Trade on DEX → OTC TX → Cross Chain
Mock
• Each dev takes ownership of their module during E2E test.
• Record screen, log bugs, and assign.
Day 9 – Final Optimisation + Deployment Ready
Jay:
• Finalise UI handoff pack (API + sample JSON responses).
• Compress wallet API calls and improve security.
Shivam:
• Merge token contract into single smart contract suite.
• Final deploy test of TokenX + interactions.
SaiRam:
• Run performance and security audit on staking and OTC.
• Prepare validator docs.
Nihal:
• Integrate UI elements with functional DEX backend.
• Setup stress test script for swap + pool actions.
Notes:
• Daily standup (4:00 PM) + EOD updates (5:30 PM).
• Use the task manager to tick off progress as daily aim.
• Push code to GitHub daily with commits tagged per task.
